Summary:
As we all konw, Fibonacci array(sequences)-also called golden spilt sequences-was named by mathematician of Fibonacci, discovered by rabbits
reproduced, and then people call Fibonacci sequences itself rabbit sequences too.

Fibonacci sequences algorithm achieved:
First of all, the sequences conform with mathmetical formula-those sequences values at the beginning token the same digit with 1. since 
equality like f1=1,f2=1,f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) were going to describe Fibonacci algorithm, in which sequences itself used to mathematical induced. 

Realizing the Fibonacci algorithm through C++ language by recursive method:
#include<iostream>
#include<stdio.h>


main()
{
  int data;
  data=getF(10);
  printf("The Fibonacci value:%d\n",data);
}

int getF(int n){
  if(n==1 || n==2){
    return 1;
   }else{
    return getF(n-1)+getF(n-2);
   }
 }

Realizing it by array: 
getF(int n){
  int f1,f2,f3; #switch method
   f1=f2=1;
  for(int i=2;i<n;i++){
    f3=f1+f2;
    f1=f2;
    f2=f3
  }   
return f3;
}
